# Accessible Accordions Examples

Code examples for the Accessible Accordions talk at the Cascade Server User Conference 2023

## About this Project

The code and examples here are adapted from a live project on sarahlawrence.edu. Both the live project and my [CSUC2023](https://conference.hannonhill.com/) talk drew inspiration from Heydon Pickering's [Inclusive Components](http://book.inclusive-components.design/) book and [examples on the companion website](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/). Credit must also be given to [Chris Ferdinandi](https://gomakethings.com/) for providing the tools and resources to make a clean break with JQuery and use Vanilla JS.

### A Note About the Example Code

As a generalist, I can't promise that the code in this repository is particularly clever. Though care and consideration have been given to efficiency, compatibility, and performance, there's always room for improvement. Your needs are specific to your use case and as such, your mileage may vary.

If you find something broken, or implemented in a tragically misguided way, open an issue or fork the project and send a PR. I'm always learning and am happy to be taught a new approach or better solution to the problems I work on.
